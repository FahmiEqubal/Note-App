## Project: Note App

https://fahmiequbal.github.io/Note-App/

### Overview

I've developed a Note App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This user-friendly web application allows users to seamlessly add, edit, and delete notes. What sets this project apart is the use of the Chrome browser's built-in database to store the notes, ensuring that users can access their notes from anywhere without the need for external servers. Key features of the project include:

- **Sleek and Intuitive Interface**: The application boasts an easy-to-use and visually appealing interface, designed for a seamless user experience.

- **Data Persistence**: Notes are securely stored in the Chrome browser's database, providing users with persistent access to their data across sessions.

- **Edit and Delete**: Users can easily edit or delete existing notes, providing flexibility and control over their content.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile platforms.
